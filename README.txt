This is a much-modified copy of GNU ReadLine version 5.0.

It was re-worked by several projects to compile on Windows, and
it has now been (somewhat...) cleaned up.  It compiles with the
Visual Studio environment on x86, x64, ARM and ARM64 platforms,
and includes resource support for the Windows platform.

It is now released as a "version 5.1" to indicate it is not the
original 5.0 release.
